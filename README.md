# Microbit Temperature Gauge

This project contains the code to impliment a basic icon based tempreture gauge with the following features:

* If its too cold, display a t-shirt icon.
* If it just right, display a tick.
* If its too warm, display a cross.
* If it's WAY to wrong, display an exclamation mark and the temperature

And finally, display the tempreture when the A button is pressed and held.
