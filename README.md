# Microbit Temperature Gauge

This project contains the code to implement a basic icon based temperature gauge with the following features:

* If its too cold, display a t-shirt icon.
* If it just right, display a tick.
* If its too warm, display a cross.
* If it's WAY too hot, display an exclamation mark and the temperature

And finally, display the temperature when the A button is pressed and held.

# Setup.

To use this project, download the code, plug you Micro:bit into you Mac or PC then copy the gauge.hex file to your Micro:bit. The code will run immediately after the copy completes.

# Editing the code.

To set the target temperature, edit the settings in the guages.py file and the convert it (using an [online editor](http://python.microbit.org/editor.html#) or [Mu](https://codewith.mu)).
